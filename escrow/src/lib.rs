#![cfg_attr(not(test), no_std)]
//! LiquiFact Escrow Contract
//!
//! Holds investor funds for an invoice until settlement.
//! - SME receives stablecoin when funding target is met ([`LiquifactEscrow::withdraw`])
//! - SME records optional **collateral commitments** ([`LiquifactEscrow::record_sme_collateral_commitment`]) —
//!   these are **ledger records only**; they do **not** move tokens, freeze balances,
//!   reserve assets, or create an enforceable on-chain claim.
//! - [`LiquifactEscrow::settle`] finalizes the escrow after maturity (when configured).
//!
//! ## Schema version ([`SCHEMA_VERSION`] / [`DataKey::Version`])
//!
//! The constant [`SCHEMA_VERSION`] is written to [`DataKey::Version`] by [`LiquifactEscrow::init`]
//! and is the canonical source of truth for upgrade decisions. **Current value: 5.**
//!
//! [`LiquifactEscrow::migrate`] **panics in all current execution paths** — no silent migration
//! work is promised or performed. Operators must extend `migrate` before calling it, or redeploy
//! when stored struct layout changes. See `docs/OPERATOR_RUNBOOK.md` for the full decision tree.
//!
//! ## SME collateral commitment metadata
//!
//! [`LiquifactEscrow::record_sme_collateral_commitment`] is an SME-authenticated metadata write for
//! off-chain risk review. The stored [`SmeCollateralCommitment`] and emitted
//! [`CollateralRecordedEvt`] are not proof of custody, lien, encumbrance, asset control, or token
//! movement. Risk teams and indexers must label this state as reported collateral metadata and must
//! verify supporting evidence outside this contract.
//!
//! ## Compliance hold (legal hold)
//!
//! An admin may set [`DataKey::LegalHold`] to block risk-bearing transitions until cleared:
//! [`LiquifactEscrow::settle`], SME [`LiquifactEscrow::withdraw`], and
//! [`LiquifactEscrow::claim_investor_payout`]. **Clearing** requires the same governance admin
//! to call [`LiquifactEscrow::set_legal_hold`] with `active = false`. This contract does not
//! embed a timelock or council multisig: production deployments should treat `admin` as a
//! governed contract or multisig so holds cannot be used for indefinite fund lock **without**
//! off-chain governance recovery (rotation, vote, emergency procedures).
//!
//! ## Invoice identifier (`invoice_id`)
//!
//! At initialization, `invoice_id` is supplied as a Soroban [`String`] and validated for length
//! and charset before conversion to [`Symbol`] for storage. Align off-chain invoice slugs with the
//! same rules (ASCII alphanumeric + `_`, max length [`MAX_INVOICE_ID_STRING_LEN`]) so indexers stay
//! unambiguous.
//!
//! ## Funding token and registry (immutable hints)
//!
//! Each escrow instance binds exactly one **funding token** contract ([`DataKey::FundingToken`])
//! at [`LiquifactEscrow::init`]; it cannot be changed after deploy. An optional **registry**
//! ([`DataKey::RegistryRef`]) is a read-only discoverability hint only — it is **not** an authority
//! for this contract and must not be used on-chain as proof of registry state without calling the
//! registry yourself.
//!
//! ## Terminal dust sweep
//!
//! [`LiquifactEscrow::sweep_terminal_dust`] moves at most [`MAX_DUST_SWEEP_AMOUNT`] units of the
//! bound funding token from this contract to the immutable **treasury** address, only when the
//! escrow has reached a **terminal** [`InvoiceEscrow::status`] (settled or withdrawn). It cannot run
//! during a legal hold. Transfers go through [`crate::external_calls`] so **pre/post token balances**
//! must match the requested amount (standard SEP-41 behavior); fee-on-transfer or malicious tokens
//! are **explicitly out of scope** and will cause safe-failure panics at the balance-check boundary.
//! This is meant for rounding residue / stray transfers, not for settling live liabilities —
//! integrations that custody principal on-chain must keep token balances reconciled with
//! `funded_amount` so treasury sweeps cannot pull user funds.
//!
//! ## Ledger time trust model
//!
//! [`LiquifactEscrow::settle`] and [`LiquifactEscrow::claim_investor_payout`] compare against
//! [`Env::ledger`] timestamps only (no wall-clock oracle). Maturity, per-investor **claim locks**
//! from [`LiquifactEscrow::fund_with_commitment`], and [`FundingCloseSnapshot`] metadata must be
//! interpreted as **validator-observed ledger time**, including possible skew between simulated and
//! live networks—integrators should treat boundaries as `>=` / `<` tests on integer seconds.
//!
//! ## Optional tiered yield (immutable table at init)
//!
//! Pass `yield_tiers` to [`LiquifactEscrow::init`] as [`Option`] of a Soroban [`Vec`] of [`YieldTier`].
//! The table is **immutable** for the escrow instance. Investors who use [`LiquifactEscrow::fund_with_commitment`]
//! on their **first** deposit select an effective [`DataKey::InvestorEffectiveYield`] from the ladder;
//! further principal from that address must use [`LiquifactEscrow::fund`]. **Fairness:** tiers are
//! validated non-decreasing in both `min_lock_secs` and `yield_bps` relative to the base [`InvoiceEscrow::yield_bps`].
//!
//! ## Funding-close snapshot (pro-rata)
//!
//! When status first becomes **funded**, [`DataKey::FundingCloseSnapshot`] stores total principal
//! (including over-funding past target), the target, and ledger timestamp/sequence. **Immutable** once
//! written; see `docs/escrow-pro-rata.md` for the authoritative pro-rata payout math and rounding rules.
//! Off-chain share for an investor is `get_contribution(addr) / snapshot.total_principal`.
