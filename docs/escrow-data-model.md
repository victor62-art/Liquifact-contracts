# Escrow Data Model

## Invoice Identifiers

Every escrow is indexed by a unique `invoice_id`, which is a Soroban `Symbol`.

### Validation Rules

To ensure compatibility with indexers and stable URL routing in off-chain dashboard systems, `invoice_id` strings provided at `init` are strictly validated:

Most scalar contract keys use `env.storage().instance()`. Instance storage is scoped to a single
contract address and is loaded in full on every host-function invocation.

The contract uses `env.storage().persistent()` for per-address entries:
`DataKey::InvestorContribution(Address)`, `DataKey::InvestorEffectiveYield(Address)`,
`DataKey::InvestorClaimNotBefore(Address)`, `DataKey::InvestorClaimed(Address)`, and
`DataKey::InvestorAllowlisted(Address)`. These are naturally modeled as independent persistent keys
with per-address TTLs (see Stellar/Soroban storage guidance on instance vs persistent storage).

Consequence: the total serialised size of all instance entries must stay within Soroban's
contract-data entry limit. Per-investor accounting no longer grows the instance footprint; investor
cardinality is still bounded by `MaxUniqueInvestorsCap` when configured.

## Related Components

## `DataKey` enum — complete reference

`DataKey` is a `#[contracttype]` enum. Each variant becomes a distinct XDR-encoded key in whichever
storage backend reads or writes it. The enum derives `Clone` so key values can be reused across
get/set calls in the same execution path without moving ownership.

### Scalar keys (always present after `init`)

| Variant | Rust type stored | Set by | Mutable? |
|---------|-----------------|--------|----------|
| `Escrow` | `InvoiceEscrow` | `init`, every state-changing entrypoint | Yes — rewritten atomically on each transition |
| `Version` | `u32` | `init` | Only via `migrate` |
| `FundingToken` | `Address` | `init` | No — immutable after init |
| `Treasury` | `Address` | `init` | No — immutable after init |
| `MinContributionFloor` | `i128` | `init` | No |
| `UniqueFunderCount` | `u32` | `init` (0), incremented by `fund_impl` | Yes — incremented on each new investor |
| `LegalHold` | `bool` | `set_legal_hold` / `clear_legal_hold` | Yes — toggled by admin |

`MinContributionFloor` is written as `0` even when no floor is configured, so reads always succeed
with `unwrap_or(0)`.

### Optional scalar keys (present only when configured)

| Variant | Rust type stored | Set by | Notes |
|---------|-----------------|--------|-------|
| `RegistryRef` | `Address` | `init` (when `registry` arg is `Some`) | Hint only — not an on-chain authority |
| `YieldTierTable` | `Vec<YieldTier>` | `init` (when non-empty tiers supplied) | Immutable after init |
| `FundingCloseSnapshot` | `FundingCloseSnapshot` | `fund_impl` on first transition to `status == 1` | Immutable once written |
| `SmeCollateralPledge` | `SmeCollateralCommitment` | `record_sme_collateral_commitment` | Record-only; replaceable by SME |
| `MaxUniqueInvestorsCap` | `u32` | `init` (when `max_unique_investors` arg is `Some`) | Absent means unlimited |
| `MaxPerInvestorCap` | `i128` | `init` (when `max_per_investor` arg is `Some`) | Absent means unlimited |
| `PrimaryAttestationHash` | `BytesN<32>` | `bind_primary_attestation_hash` | Single-set; panics on second call |
| `AttestationAppendLog` | `Vec<BytesN<32>>` | `append_attestation_digest` | Bounded by `MAX_ATTESTATION_APPEND_ENTRIES` (32) |
| `SettledAt` | `u64` | `settle` on status 1→2 transition | Write-once; `None` before settlement; legacy-safe |
| `FundingDeadline` | `u64` | `init` (when `funding_deadline` arg is `Some`) | Ledger timestamp; new funds rejected after this |

### Per-address investor keys in persistent storage

These variants carry an `Address` discriminator so each investor gets an independent persistent
storage slot and TTL.

| Variant | Rust type stored | Set by | Default when absent |
|---------|-----------------|--------|---------------------|
| `InvestorContribution(Address)` | `i128` | `fund_impl` | `0` |
| `InvestorClaimed(Address)` | `bool` | `claim_investor_payout` | `false` |
| `InvestorEffectiveYield(Address)` | `i64` (bps) | `fund_impl` on first deposit | `InvoiceEscrow::yield_bps` |
| `InvestorClaimNotBefore(Address)` | `u64` (ledger timestamp) | `fund_impl` on first deposit | `0` (no gate) |

All four per-address keys are written together on an investor's first `fund` or
`fund_with_commitment` call. Subsequent `fund` calls update only `InvestorContribution`.

### Per-address allowlist keys in persistent storage

These entries also live in **persistent** storage (not instance storage).

| Variant | Rust type stored | Set by | Default when absent |
|---------|------------------|--------|---------------------|
| `InvestorAllowlisted(Address)` | `bool` | `set_investor_allowlisted` | `false` |

When `AllowlistActive` is enabled (instance storage flag), `fund_impl` gates `fund` and
`fund_with_commitment` by asserting `InvestorAllowlisted(investor) == true`. Only the admin may
mutate allowlist membership.

## Stored struct reference

### `InvoiceEscrow` (stored at `DataKey::Escrow`)

```rust
pub struct InvoiceEscrow {
    pub invoice_id: Symbol,       // validated ASCII [A-Za-z0-9_], max 32 chars
    pub admin: Address,
    pub sme_address: Address,
    pub amount: i128,             // original invoice face value
    pub funding_target: i128,     // may be updated while status == 0
    pub funded_amount: i128,      // running total; checked_add on each fund call
    pub yield_bps: i64,           // base annualised yield, 0..=10_000
    pub maturity: u64,            // ledger timestamp; 0 = no maturity gate
    pub status: u32,              // 0=open 1=funded 2=settled 3=withdrawn
}
```

`status` transitions are strictly forward. See [ADR-001](adr/ADR-001-state-model.md).

### `FundingCloseSnapshot` (stored at `DataKey::FundingCloseSnapshot`)

```rust
pub struct FundingCloseSnapshot {
    pub total_principal: i128,           // funded_amount at the moment status became 1
    pub funding_target: i128,
    pub closed_at_ledger_timestamp: u64,
    pub closed_at_ledger_sequence: u32,
}
```

Written once, atomically, inside `fund_impl` on the first transition to `status == 1`. Immutable
thereafter. Off-chain pro-rata share: `get_contribution(addr) / snapshot.total_principal`.

### `EscrowSummary` (composite return type from `get_escrow_summary`)

Not stored directly; assembled at read time from multiple storage keys. Combines core escrow state
with three metadata families so callers obtain a complete view in a single host invocation.

```rust
pub struct EscrowSummary {
    pub escrow: InvoiceEscrow,
    pub has_maturity_lock: bool,
    pub legal_hold: bool,
    pub funding_close_snapshot: EscrowCloseSnapshot,
    pub unique_funder_count: u32,
    pub is_allowlist_active: bool,
    pub schema_version: u32,
    pub sme_collateral_commitment: Option<SmeCollateralCommitment>,
    pub has_primary_attestation: bool,
    pub attestation_log_length: u32,
}
```

- `sme_collateral_commitment` — pulled from `DataKey::SmeCollateralPledge`; `None` when never recorded.
- `has_primary_attestation` — `true` when `DataKey::PrimaryAttestationHash` is present.
- `attestation_log_length` — length of the `Vec` stored at `DataKey::AttestationAppendLog`; `0` when absent.

Legacy instances (no collateral or attestation keys) return `None` / `false` / `0` respectively,
per the additive-key policy.

### `SmeCollateralCommitment` (stored at `DataKey::SmeCollateralPledge`)

```rust
pub struct SmeCollateralCommitment {
    pub asset: Symbol,
    pub amount: i128,
    pub recorded_at: u64,   // ledger timestamp at record time
}
```

Record-only. Does not custody tokens or trigger liquidation.

### `YieldTier` (element of `Vec<YieldTier>` at `DataKey::YieldTierTable`)

```rust
pub struct YieldTier {
    pub min_lock_secs: u64,
    pub yield_bps: i64,
}
```

Validated at `init`: `min_lock_secs` strictly increasing, `yield_bps` non-decreasing and each
`>= base yield_bps`. See [ADR-005](adr/ADR-005-tiered-yield.md).

## Schema version

`DataKey::Version` stores a `u32` written as `SCHEMA_VERSION` (currently `6`) at `init`. The
`migrate` entrypoint validates `from_version == stored` before applying any migration path. No
migration paths are currently implemented; adding a new optional key does not require a version bump
(see additive-key policy below).

---

## Additive-key policy

A new `DataKey` variant is **backward-compatible** when:

1. It is read with `.get(...).unwrap_or(default)` so old deployments (where the key is absent)
   behave as "unset / default".
2. It does not change the XDR shape of any existing variant or stored struct.
3. It does not alter the semantics of existing entrypoints when absent.

A change is **breaking** (requires migration or redeploy) when:

- An existing stored struct gains a required field (e.g. a new non-optional field on
  `InvoiceEscrow`).
- An existing `DataKey` variant is renamed or its XDR discriminant changes.
- An existing key's stored type changes (e.g. `LegalHold` from `bool` to `u32`).

See [ADR-007](adr/ADR-007-storage-key-evolution.md) for the full decision record and compatibility
test plan.

## Private typed accessors

Two private helpers centralise storage reads for immutable addresses, ensuring consistent
error codes across all entrypoints:

| Accessor | Key read | Error on absence |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| `funding_token_or_fail(&env)` | `DataKey::FundingToken` | [`EscrowError::FundingTokenNotSet`] (code 21) |
| `treasury_or_fail(&env)` | `DataKey::Treasury` | [`EscrowError::TreasuryNotSet`] (code 22) |

Both are defined as `fn(&Env) -> Address` inside `impl LiquifactEscrow` (not public
entrypoints). They panic with the typed error listed above when called before `init`.
The public getters `get_funding_token` and `get_treasury` delegate to them; internal
callers (`sweep_terminal_dust`, `refund`) also use them instead of inlining the
`.get().unwrap_or_else(|| fail(...))` pattern.

---

## Security notes

- **Token economics:** `external_calls::transfer_funding_token_with_balance_checks` asserts exact
  pre/post balance deltas. Fee-on-transfer or rebasing tokens are out of scope and will cause a
  safe panic. See [ADR-006](adr/ADR-006-dust-sweep-and-token-safety.md).
- **Collateral record:** `SmeCollateralPledge` is metadata only. It is not proof of encumbrance
  until a future version explicitly enforces token transfers.
- **Registry hint:** `RegistryRef` must not be used as an authority without verifying registry
  behavior off-chain or in a dedicated integration.
- **Attestation digests:** `PrimaryAttestationHash` and `AttestationAppendLog` store raw byte
  digests. The contract does not verify what the digest commits to; that is an off-chain concern.
- **Storage growth:** per-address investor keys use persistent storage to avoid unbounded instance
  growth. `MaxUniqueInvestorsCap` can still bound investor count. Any schema change that adds
  per-address keys must re-evaluate storage footprint and TTL behavior.
